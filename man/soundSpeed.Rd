\title{Calculate the Speed of Sound in Water Using the Mackenzie Equation}
\usage{
soundSpeed(temp = 21, sal = 34, depth = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{temp}{Numeric vector or single value of temperature (°C).}

\item{sal}{Numeric vector or single value of salinity (PSU).}

\item{depth}{Numeric vector or single value of depth (m).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the speed of sound in water (m/s).
}
\description{
This function estimates the speed of sound in water using a simplified version
of the Mackenzie equation (Mackenzie, 1981). The calculation is based on
temperature, salinity, and depth.
}
\examples{
# Calculate sound speed for given temperature, salinity, and depth
soundSpeed(temp = 21, sal = 37, depth = 20)

# Vectorized example
temps <- c(10, 15, 20, 25)
sound_speeds <- soundSpeed(temp = temps, sal = 35, depth = 50)
print(sound_speeds)
